# AGENTS.md — Athena Workspace

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for any Athena-related tasks.

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION — SESSION BOOT (auto-`/start`)**: At the very start of every new session, BEFORE responding to the user's first message, run the `/start` workflow yourself — pre-load `.agent/workflows/_shared.md`, then execute `.agent/workflows/start.md` (Phase 1 boot onward: Core Identity → activeContext checkpoint → accountability surface → maintenance-ratio). Do it automatically; do not ask whether to boot (the user configured this on 2026-07-22). Then answer their first message in the same turn — boot fast (MinMax), fold their opener into the reply; a bare greeting just gets the `⚡ Ready` confirmation. If this session has already booted, skip. *(In Claude Code a `SessionStart` hook enforces this in code. Antigravity's IDE has no session-start hook event, so in AG — and any other agent reading this file — THIS instruction is the trigger: honor it as a hard rule, not a suggestion.)*

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION — ASCII-ONLY MATH & CURRENCY (hard rule)**: Never emit LaTeX/KaTeX math delimiters in any user-facing output OR any file you write — no `$…$`, `$$…$$`, `\(…\)`, `\[…\]`, or `\text{…}`. Render every formula, statistic, confidence interval, Big-O term, and currency in plain ASCII / Unicode / code blocks. Write `EV = +10.45% (95% CI [+4.00%, +16.98%])`, `O(N^2)`, and `S$1,300` — NEVER `$O(N^2)$` or `$\text{EV}$`. Bare currency with no closing delimiter (`S$1,300`, `$500`) is correct and must NOT be altered. The user's UI (Antigravity/KaTeX) renders LaTeX as a broken "Failed to render" banner.

This file provides persistent context to any AI coding agent working in this workspace. The information below is available on every turn without needing to be explicitly requested.

## Retrieval Strategy

When working on any task in this workspace, read in this order (files that don't exist have been consolidated — don't look for them):

1. **`.context/CANONICAL.md`** — materialized view of active facts (supersedes session logs on conflict)
2. **`.context/glossary.md`** — decoder ring for user shorthand, acronyms, internal language (lookup cascade: CANONICAL → glossary → Exocortex → ask user)
3. **`.context/META_PATTERNS.md`** — 7 cross-domain meta-patterns (enables thematic retrieval across all case studies/protocols)
4. **`.context/META_LEARNING.md`** — longitudinal behavioral tracking (how the user has changed over time, not just current state)
5. **`.context/memory_bank/activeContext.md`** — current session state, active tasks
6. **`.context/PROJECTS.md`** — project switchboard (supersedes the old `project_state.md`, which is deprecated)
7. **`.context/PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.md` / `PROTOCOL_HEATMAP.md`** — protocol discovery (supersedes the retired `TAG_INDEX.md`)
8. **`.context/CASE_STUDY_INDEX.md`** — case-study lookup
9. **`.context/TECH_DEBT.md`** — known debt before proposing new work
10. **`.agent/CONNECTORS.md`** — tool abstraction mapping (~~category → MCP server). Read when writing new skills.
11. **Read authoritative source files** before generating code from training data

---

## Workflow Execution

When executing **any** workflow (slash command):

1. **Pre-load** `.agent/workflows/_shared.md` — shared conventions, sources of truth, anti-patterns
2. **Then** load the specific workflow file
3. **Respect** `DATA_CONTRACT.md` ownership boundaries during execution

> `_shared.md` is the equivalent of a base class — every workflow inherits its rules without duplicating them.

### Root vs. `_domain/` workflows

`.agent/workflows/` has two tiers:

- **Root tier** (51 files): always loadable. Examples: `/do`, `/start`, `/end`, `/plan`, `/audit`, `/gto`, `/ultrathink`.
- **Domain tier** (`.agent/workflows/_domain/`, 18 files): dormant by default, activated only when the query implies a specific domain. Examples: `ads.md`, `brand-generator.md`, `ugc-factory.md`, `deploy-website.md`, `ui-ux-pro-max.md`, `archive.md` (URL → library archiver), `archive-client.md` (client handoff), `foresight.md` (SOTA predictive positioning).

**Activation rule** for domain workflows: `/do` resolves a domain command only when (a) the active project in `PROJECTS.md` matches the domain prefix, (b) the query contains domain-specific nouns (e.g., "ads", "ugc", "client handoff"), or (c) the user prefixes explicitly (e.g., `/archive https://...`). If unclear, `/do` asks before routing.

**Disambiguation note**: `/archive` resolves to `_domain/archive.md` (URL archiver). For archiving a client engagement use `/archive-client`. For archiving deprecated protocols, edit `.archive/` directly — no workflow required.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- ❌ Generating code based solely on training data
- ❌ Ignoring existing protocols/patterns in `.agent/skills/protocols/`
- ❌ Skipping `/start` boot sequence
- ❌ Not filing insights on `/end`
- ❌ **Responding from internal knowledge alone** when tools are available. Use Exocortex (`mcp_athena_smart_search`), `search_web`, `read_url_content`, MCP servers, `grep_search`, browser sub-agent, and command execution to ground every non-trivial response. Training data is stale — live tools are not.
- ❌ **Silent guessing on requirements or architecture**: Ask, don't assume. If unclear, ask before writing code.
- ❌ **Reasoning from the official narrative without a substance decode** (PAT-574): for any institutional act, political event, or audience-facing output, run Prior → Discriminators → Payoff-weighted action before generating. Form ≠ Substance.
- ❌ **Leaving documentation behind**: Auto-sync local project docs/READMEs on session close.
- ❌ **Believing prose is a mechanism** (S534): if a protocol says "the system continuously monitors / automatically emits / always-on" but no code in `.agent/scripts/` does it, it is a heuristic you must apply *yourself* — not a running process. Don't skip the manual step assuming a daemon has it; don't report "compliance" with a process that never executed. See Epistemic Status Convention in `_shared.md`.
- ❌ **Fixing a guard without showing it fail** — see *Red Run or It Didn't Happen* below.
- ❌ **Using LaTeX math delimiters** — see the *ASCII-Only Math & Currency* hard rule at the top of this file.

### Red Run or It Didn't Happen (hard rule for guard fixes)

> Any change that claims to fix a check, test, gate, linter, or CI step MUST
> include the guard **failing** on the pre-fix state, then passing on the fixed
> state. Put both in the commit message.

If you cannot make it go red, you have not found the guard's edge — you have found its blind spot. Never optimize the indicator over the property (e.g. running a writer instead of a checker, assertions checking types instead of invariants, or scanners excluding themselves). The red run proves the indicator is wired to the invariant.

Corollaries:

- **Mutation over assertion count.** Break the thing the guard protects and
  watch it fail. A test that survives the mutation is decoration.
- **A narrowed scope is a silent cap.** If a check covers a subset, it must say
  what it covered and fail on anything undeclared — never print a claim broader
  than what it verified.
- **A skip is not a pass.** Converting an assertion to `pytest.skip` removes the
  guard. Skip on an explicit, named condition, and assert on the other branch.
- **Renaming to clear a static-analysis alert is a dismissal, not a fix.** Do it
  if the name is genuinely wrong, but record it as a false positive rather than
  letting the ledger read "fixed".

### The Immutable Test Invariant (Anti-Goodhart & Seams Protection)

> **HARD RULE**: When a test or verification gate fails, source code must be corrected to satisfy the contract — NEVER loosen test assertions, comment out checks (`skip`), or mock the contract solely to achieve a green exit code.

- **Source Fixes Test**: The implementation must fix the defect; the test defines the invariant. Modifying existing test files to make a failing suite pass requires explicit user authorization.
- **Test at Seams**: Tests must target public interfaces, API boundaries, and system seams — never volatile private implementation details. Refactoring internal implementation must leave seam tests green and unmodified.
- **Legacy Test Transition Protocol**: If a refactoring breaks an obsolete test tightly coupled to superseded private implementation details rather than the public contract, test weakening remains prohibited. Present the user with an explicit `[Legacy Test Transition Request]` to elevate the test to an API seam or retire it upon approval.

### Oscillation & Loop Circuit Breaker (The 3-Round Rule)

- **Fix Pass Blast Cap**: Cap modifications per single fix pass to at most ~10% of affected files/symbols. Never attempt wide-sweep rewrites within an unverified repair loop.
- **Oscillation Detector**: If 3 consecutive iterations yield identical tool calls, repeating error signatures, or code oscillation (flipping edits back and forth between state A and state B), HALT immediately.
- **Loop-Breaker Action**: Name the detected loop, change exactly ONE underlying assumption or variable, and retry once. If failure persists, halt and present 2–3 concrete trade-off options with a single diagnostic question.

### Verification Gap Declaration (The Gap-Round)

Upon delivery or completion claims (`walkthrough.md` or concluding response), explicitly declare:
1. **What was computationally verified**: Exact commands and terminal proof (exit code 0).
2. **What was NOT verified**: Omissions, edge cases, or paths skipped due to environment constraints.
3. **Critical unverified boundaries**: Any unverified boundary carrying critical risk blocks delivery (`BLOCKED`) pending explicit user review.


### External Verification Mandate

> **MANDATORY**: Every non-trivial response MUST invoke at least ONE external tool before generating output (Exocortex, web search, file reads, MCP, grep, commands).
>
> - **SNIPER (Λ < 10)**: Exempt. Direct answer allowed.
> - **STANDARD (Λ 10-30)**: Call `context_gate(query)`; satisfy any `missing` requirements.
> - **ULTRA (Λ > 30)**: Call `context_gate(query)`; requires semantic AND (web OR page-read).
>
> **Epistemic status**: `code-enforced` via `.agents/hooks.json` Stop lifecycle gate `stop_governance_gate.py`.

## Multi-Agent Safety (Protocol 413)

When multiple AI agents work in this repository simultaneously:

- **Never** `git stash` create/apply/drop — assumes other agents have WIP
- **Never** switch branches or modify worktrees without explicit request
- **Always** `git pull --rebase` before pushing
- **Commit only your changes** — when you see unrecognized files from other agents, ignore them
- **Lint/format diffs** that are formatting-only: auto-resolve without asking
- **Focus reports on your edits** — avoid guardrail disclaimers unless truly blocked

See [Protocol 413](.framework/v8.2-stable/protocols/413_Multi_Agent_Coordination.md) for full rules.

## SOTA GTO Execution Framework

To ensure Game-Theory Optimal (GTO) operations, apply these core engineering directives on every task:

1. **Strategic Minimaxing**: When selecting implementation paths, run a minimax mental model. Define the worst-case scenario (ruin class) and design asymmetric upside mechanisms. Optimize for long-term codebase health (low technical debt) over short-term expediency.
2. **Context & Jargon Engineering**: Always translate user requests against `.context/glossary.md` before coding. Avoid generating redundant text or unnecessary docstrings that pollute the attention window. Maintain clean, modular code with small, deep interfaces (Protocol 60).
3. **Execution Loop Hygiene**: Strictly follow the red-green-refactor testing protocol (TDD). Never skip automated verification commands (`python3 .agent/scripts/run_tests.py` or local run scripts).
4. **Isolated Parallel Audits**: For complex refactoring or reviews, utilize parallel sub-agents (Protocol 61) to evaluate Spec Compliance and Quality Standards independently, avoiding confirmation bias.
