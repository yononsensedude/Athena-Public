"""
Single source of truth version synchronizer.

Two modes:
  (default)  rewrite every declared surface to match pyproject.toml
  --check    report drift and exit 1 without writing anything (for CI)

--check exists because running the writer in CI is not a check: it rewrote the
files inside the runner, discarded them with the workspace, and exited 0
whatever the state of the commit. Version drift could never fail the build.

The narrower failure that replaced it: --check covered three files
(pyproject.toml, src/athena/__init__.py, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), printed "All
version references consistent", and exited 0 — while the same tree carried
9.9.6 in CAPS.json, 9.9.7 across four docs and eight wiki pages, and 9.9.8 in
AGENTS.md and README.md. A guard scoped to the files that already agree is a
guard that cannot fail, wearing a green check.

So this script does two things, and the second is the one that matters:

  1. DECLARED SURFACES — every place the repo states its own version, checked
     against the SSOT.
  2. DISCOVERY — a sweep of every tracked text file for version-shaped strings.
     Anything not covered by a declared surface or an explicit exemption fails
     the check. A new version claim cannot appear silently; it must be declared
     as a surface or exempted with a stated reason.

Adding a version stamp somewhere new now costs one line in SURFACES. That is
the point: the cost of a silent surface is a wrong number shipped to users.
