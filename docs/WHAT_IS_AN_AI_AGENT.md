# What Is an AI Agent?

> An AI agent is software that can act on your behalf — with memory, context, and autonomy.

## Chatbot vs Agent

| Chatbot | Agent |
|---------|-------|
| Forgets you after each conversation | Remembers context across sessions |
| Follows instructions | Follows instructions AND takes initiative |
| Exists only during chat | Can run in the background |
| One-size-fits-all | Customized to your needs |

## The Persistence Problem

Every AI conversation faces the same issue: **session death**.

When you close the chat, the AI forgets everything. Next time you talk, it starts from zero.

Platform "memory" features (ChatGPT, Claude) help, but they're:

- **Platform-locked** — switch models, lose everything
- **Opaque** — you don't control what's remembered
- **Limited** — can't handle complex, long-term context

## How Athena Solves It

Athena stores your AI's memory in **files you own** (Read the [Manifesto](../.framework/v8.2-stable/MANIFESTO.md)):

```
.context/
├── memory_bank/
│   └── activeContext.md  # Current status & active tasks
├── Recent_Decisions.md   # What you decided and why
└── session_logs/         # Every conversation, indexed
```

Your data is:

- **Portable** — Markdown files, git-versioned
- **Yours** — stored locally, not on a platform
- **Searchable** — [Semantic Search](./SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md) across everything

## What Makes an Agent "Sovereign"?

A **sovereign agent** has:

1. **Persistent Identity** — It knows who it is across sessions
2. **Owned Memory** — Data lives on your machine, not a cloud service
3. **Autonomous Capability** — Can act when you're not present
4. **Platform Independence** — Works with any LLM (Claude, Gemini, GPT)

Athena helps you build sovereign agents.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Session Continuity

You're on Session 1,900. You ask: "What did we decide about the API structure in Session 19?"

A chatbot: "I don't know."
An agent: "In Session 19, we decided to use REST with JSON-RPC hybrid. Here's the reasoning..."

### 2. Autonomous Operations

Your agent checks a social network every 4 hours, posts content, and logs what happened — even while you sleep.

### 3. Cross-Model Portability

You switch from Claude to Gemini. A chatbot loses all context. Your agent loads the same `activeContext.md` and continues seamlessly.
