## Relationship Map

| Entity | Relates To | Relationship |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Protocol 404 | All Skills | Foundation (fetch before act) |
| Protocol 409 | Protocol 416 | Enables (worktrees → swarm) |
| Session Logs | Memory | Persists context across sessions |
| Committee Seats | Decision Making | Multi-perspective validation |
| Laws | All Actions | Constraint system |

## Quick Lookup

- **Lost context?** → Check `session_logs/` for recent memory
- **Need a protocol?** → Search `examples/protocols/` by category
- **Building new feature?** → Start with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Debugging AI behavior?** → Check Laws in `Core_Identity.md`

> **Note**: GraphRAG was removed as an active retrieval channel in S435 (6 June 2026). Retrieval now uses 6 channels: Canonical, Vector (pgvector), Tag Index, Filename, Keyword, and Agentic Search.
