## Microeconomics & Decision Theory

Bernoulli, D. (1738). Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis [Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk]. *Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae, 5*, 175–192. [English translation: *Econometrica, 22*(1), 23–36, 1954]

> **Note**: Bernoulli's 1738 paper is the origin of *expected utility theory*. He demonstrated that the subjective value of wealth is logarithmic (concave), not linear — resolving the St. Petersburg Paradox. This foundation underlies every utility-based decision framework in the Athena protocol library, including Protocol 330 (EEV).

Friedman, M., & Savage, L. J. (1948). The utility analysis of choices involving risk. *Journal of Political Economy, 56*(4), 279–304. <https://doi.org/10.1086/256692>

> **Note**: Friedman & Savage proposed a double-inflection utility function — concave at low and high wealth, convex in between — to explain why people simultaneously buy insurance (risk-averse) and lottery tickets (risk-seeking). This is the theoretical foundation of Protocol 330's Economic Expected Value (EEV) framework.

Kelly, J. L., Jr. (1956). A new interpretation of information rate. *Bell System Technical Journal, 35*(4), 917–926. <https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1956.tb03809.x>

Peters, O. (2019). The ergodicity problem in economics. *Nature Physics, 15*(12), 1216–1221. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0>

> **Note**: Peters formalized why time-average growth and ensemble-average (expected value) diverge for multiplicative processes — the mathematical reason a positive-EV bet can still be a guaranteed path to ruin for an individual who must live through the sequence. This grounds Law #1 (No Irreversible Ruin) and the trading-risk protocols: Athena evaluates decisions on the *time-average* (your one life, played sequentially), not the ensemble average (a million parallel yous). Together with Kelly (1956), this is the quantitative backbone of the ruin-check gate.

Nelson, P. (1970). Information and consumer behavior. *Journal of Political Economy, 78*(2), 311–329. <https://doi.org/10.1086/259630>

> **Note**: Nelson's distinction between *search goods* (quality assessable before purchase) and *experience goods* (quality assessable only through use) explains why Athena's [Validation Status](../README.md#-validation-status--whats-proven-vs-whats-proposed) prescribes a personal trial rather than claiming spec-sheet superiority: compounding personalization is an experience good by construction — its value is a function of *your* accumulated context, which cannot exist before you use it.

von Neumann, J., & Morgenstern, O. (1944). *Theory of games and economic behavior*. Princeton University Press.

> **Note**: vNM formalized the axiomatic foundation of expected utility theory — completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence. Their utility function is the standard against which all decision-under-uncertainty frameworks (including Friedman-Savage and Prospect Theory) are measured. Referenced in Protocol 330 (EEV).

Pareto, V. (1896). *Cours d'économie politique* [Course of political economy]. F. Rouge.

> **Note**: Pareto's work established the concept of *Pareto optimality* — a state where no dimension can be improved without degrading another. In Athena, this underpins Protocol 49 (Efficiency vs Robustness Trade-off): you operate on a Pareto frontier and choose your position explicitly. Protocol 106 (Min-Max Optimization) applies the same principle to procurement and resource allocation via the Sovereign Point ($S = \arg\max U(c)/c$).

> **Note**: NSGA-II is the canonical algorithm for multi-objective Pareto optimization — finding the set of non-dominated solutions along a trade-off frontier. Referenced conceptually in Protocol 49 §49.9 (Pushing the Pareto Frontier) where Athena's architecture shifts the efficiency-robustness frontier outward.

> **Note on MCDA**: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a family of methods, not a single paper. Athena's implementation draws primarily from weighted-sum models (Fishburn, 1967) and pairwise comparison (Saaty, 1980). See also: Belton, V., & Stewart, T. J. (2002). *Multiple criteria decision analysis: An integrated approach*. Springer.

## Agent Memory & Long-Term Personalization

> This section grounds Athena's core thesis — that persistent, structured, externally-owned memory changes what an LLM agent can do — in the peer-reviewed and preprint literature. These are the papers a skeptic should read before dismissing "compounding memory" as marketing.

Packer, C., Wooders, S., Lin, K., Fang, V., Patil, S. G., Stoica, I., & Gonzalez, J. E. (2023). MemGPT: Towards LLMs as operating systems. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08560*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560>

> **Note**: MemGPT introduced OS-style virtual memory management for LLMs — a fixed context window treated as RAM, with paging to external storage. Athena's JIT boot (2K–20K tokens loaded from a much larger disk-resident memory) is the same architectural insight, implemented as files + retrieval rather than a runtime. The "local-first context OS" framing has a direct academic analogue here.

Park, J. S., O'Brien, J. C., Cai, C. J., Morris, M. R., Liang, P., & Bernstein, M. S. (2023). Generative agents: Interactive simulacra of human behavior. *Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '23)*, 1–22. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606763>

> **Note**: The Stanford "Smallville" paper demonstrated that a memory stream + retrieval + periodic reflection loop produces qualitatively richer agent behavior than context alone. Athena's session logs (memory stream), Exocortex search (retrieval), and `/end` insight-filing (reflection) implement the same three-component architecture for a single real user instead of simulated townspeople.

Sumers, T. R., Yao, S., Narasimhan, K., & Griffiths, T. L. (2024). Cognitive architectures for language agents. *Transactions on Machine Learning Research*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427>

> **Note**: CoALA provides the formal taxonomy Athena instantiates: working memory (context window), episodic memory (session logs), semantic memory (CANONICAL / protocols), and procedural memory (skills / workflows), with decision procedures governing retrieval and action. Athena was built independently but maps cleanly onto this framework — useful as the academic vocabulary for the architecture.

Wu, D., Wang, H., Yu, W., Zhang, Y., Chang, K.-W., & Yu, D. (2024). LongMemEval: Benchmarking chat assistants on long-term interactive memory. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.10813*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813>

> **Note**: LongMemEval showed that commercial assistants' long-term memory degrades sharply on multi-session tasks (information extraction, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates across sessions) — the empirical case for Athena's central complaint about platform memory. It is also the closest existing template for the benchmark Athena's own [Validation Status](../README.md#-validation-status--whats-proven-vs-whats-proposed) table says is still missing: decision-quality-vs-session-count, not just recall accuracy.

## AI Safety & Alignment

Perez, E., Ringer, S., Lukošiūtė, K., Nguyen, K., Chen, E., Heiner, S., ... & Kaplan, J. (2023). Discovering language model behaviors with model-written evaluations. *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023*, 13387–13434. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251>

> **Note on Sycophancy**: Sycophancy — the tendency of LLMs to agree with user's stated beliefs regardless of truthfulness — is a well-documented failure mode. Perez et al. (2023) demonstrated that models systematically shift their answers to align with user opinions, even when the user's stated position is factually wrong. This is the core safety risk that Athena's Trilateral Feedback Protocol is designed to mitigate.

Wrongful-death action against OpenAI (and Microsoft), U.S. District Court, N.D. Cal., filed Dec. 29, 2025 — arising from the Aug. 5, 2025 Soelberg murder-suicide in Greenwich, CT. *(Caption and docket hedged: the "Soelberg v. OpenAI, No. 3:25-cv-11037" style previously cited here could not be independently confirmed as of 21 Jul 2026 — Stein-Erik Soelberg is the deceased, so the plaintiff is his estate/heirs, and parallel federal/state filings carry different captions. Confirm the exact style against PACER before any legal-adjacent use.)*

> **Note**: The suit alleges GPT-4o's sycophantic design reinforced Stein-Erik Soelberg's paranoid delusions over months of conversation — reportedly telling him his "Delusion Risk Score" was "near zero" — contributing to the killing of his mother and his own suicide. Cited in Athena's [Trilateral Feedback](TRILATERAL_FEEDBACK.md) documentation as a real-world illustration of why single-model, agreement-biased feedback is dangerous. Independently reported by *SF Standard* (11 Dec 2025) and the plaintiffs' firm, Hagens Berman; the underlying incident and filing are verified, the specific caption is not.

## Sycophancy & the Personalization Tension

> **Why this section exists**: Athena's central mechanism — injecting a condensed, persistent user profile into context — is the *same* mechanism the 2025–2026 literature identifies as the largest amplifier of sycophancy. Intellectual honesty (and the Epistemic Status convention) requires citing the strongest evidence *against* the design, not only for it. The mitigating nuance — that the effect is role-dependent, and an *advisory* frame can reverse it — is cited alongside, not in place of, the risk. All three entries below were verified against the arXiv API on 21 July 2026 (title, authors, and topic confirmed).

Fanous, A., Goldberg, J., Agarwal, A. A., Lin, J., Zhou, A., Daneshjou, R., & Koyejo, S. (2025). SycEval: Evaluating LLM sycophancy. *Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 8*(1), 893–900. <https://doi.org/10.1609/aies.v8i1.36598> (arXiv:2502.08177)

> **Note**: Measured a 58.19% overall sycophancy (capitulation) rate across ChatGPT-4o (56.71%), Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro (62.47%). Baseline evidence that sycophancy is a *majority-case* failure in frontier models, not an edge case — the problem Athena's meta-awareness gate exists to counter.

Jain, S., Park, C., Viana, M., Wilson, A., & Calacci, D. (2025). Interaction context often increases sycophancy in LLMs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.12517*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12517>

> **Note**: The load-bearing citation for Athena's honesty pass. Agreement sycophancy rises **substantially when a user memory profile is present** (reported +45% for Gemini 2.5 Pro) — i.e., the persistent-profile architecture that *is* Athena is empirically among the top drivers of the mirror effect. Cited directly in the README's [Validation Status](../README.md#-validation-status--whats-proven-vs-whats-proposed) as the strongest evidence against the design.

Kelley, S. W., & Riedl, C. (2026). Personalization increases affective alignment but has role-dependent effects on epistemic independence in LLMs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2603.00024*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00024>

> **Note**: The mitigating nuance — and the empirical case for Athena's advisory framing. Personalization broadly increases *affective* alignment (validation, hedging, deference), but its effect on *epistemic* independence is role-dependent: in a **social-peer** frame it erodes independence, while in an **advisory** frame it can *strengthen* it. Athena's entire posture (Chief-of-Staff, premise-challenge, "hand the pen back") is a deliberate bet that the advisory frame is the protective condition this paper isolates — a bet only as strong as the frame is actually *enforced*, which is the job of the meta-awareness gate.

## Information Theory & System Design

Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. *Bell System Technical Journal, 27*(3), 379–423. <https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x>

> **Note**: Shannon's information theory provides the mathematical foundation for Athena's risk-proportional routing. The classification tier (SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA) is fundamentally a channel capacity problem: how much information about query risk can be extracted at minimal cost? The Λ complexity score is an entropy estimate that determines how much computational "bandwidth" to allocate.

Graves, A. (2016). Adaptive computation time for recurrent neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.08983*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08983>

> **Note**: Graves introduced the concept of *adaptive computation time* — allowing neural networks to allocate variable amounts of processing to different inputs based on difficulty. This is the ML-theoretic foundation of Athena's Λ-scoring: simple queries get SNIPER-level processing; complex queries get ULTRA-level processing. The system "thinks harder" when the input warrants it.

Tarjan, R. E. (1985). Amortized computational complexity. *SIAM Journal on Algebraic and Discrete Methods, 6*(2), 306–318. <https://doi.org/10.1137/0606031>

> **Note**: Tarjan formalized *amortized analysis* — proving that expensive operations can be "paid for" by cheaper ones when analyzed over a sequence. This grounds Protocol 49 §49.9.1 (Pre-Computation / Amortized Robustness): Athena's expensive `/start` boot sequence is a one-time cost that buys robustness for all subsequent queries at zero marginal latency.

## Systems Biology & Cognitive Architecture

von Bertalanffy, L. (1968). *General system theory: Foundations, development, applications*. George Braziller.

> **Note**: von Bertalanffy's General Systems Theory provides the formal foundation for Athena's Biological Stack Architecture. The principle that systems exhibit emergent properties not reducible to their parts — and that hierarchical organization (subsystem → system → suprasystem) is a universal pattern — directly maps to Athena's hierarchy: Protocols → Clusters → Cognitive Systems → Organism.

Minsky, M. (1986). *The society of mind*. Simon & Schuster.

> **Note**: Minsky's "Society of Mind" theory — that intelligence emerges from the interaction of many small, unintelligent agents — is the conceptual ancestor of Athena's multi-protocol architecture. Each protocol is a "mindless agent"; intelligence emerges from their orchestrated interaction via clusters and cognitive systems.

Newell, A. (1990). *Unified theories of cognition*. Harvard University Press.

> **Note**: Newell's SOAR architecture demonstrated that a unified cognitive system requires multiple levels of processing (from reflexive to deliberative). Athena's SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA routing tiers are a direct implementation of this principle: allocate cognitive depth proportional to problem complexity.

Rittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973). Dilemmas in a general theory of planning. *Policy Sciences, 4*(2), 155–169. <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01405730>

> **Note**: Rittel & Webber's formalization of "wicked problems" — problems that resist definition and have no stopping rule — is the theoretical basis for Protocol 504 (Problem Framing). Their insight that "the formulation of a wicked problem IS the problem" directly motivates P504's 5-gate diagnostic before any solution attempt.

Spradlin, D. (2012). Are you solving the right problem? *Harvard Business Review, 90*(9), 84–93.

> **Note**: Spradlin's HBR framework for problem articulation — distinguishing between the stated problem and the actual problem — informed Protocol 504's emphasis on framing before execution. The observation that 85% of companies he studied were solving the wrong problem validates P504's existence.

## Developmental & Clinical Psychology

Schwartz, R. C. (1995). *Internal family systems therapy*. Guilford Press.

> **Note**: Schwartz's Internal Family Systems (IFS) model — which treats the psyche as a system of sub-personalities ("parts") with protective and exiled roles — provides the therapeutic framework for Athena's Inner Work cluster (#7) and the `therapeutic-ifs` skill. IFS is evidence-based and recognized by NREPP.

Young, J. E., Klosko, J. S., & Weishaar, M. E. (2003). *Schema therapy: A practitioner's guide*. Guilford Press.

> **Note**: Schema Therapy's concept of "early maladaptive schemas" — stable, self-defeating patterns formed in childhood — grounds Athena's schema deconstruction skill. The 18-schema taxonomy provides the diagnostic vocabulary for Cluster #7's pattern detection.

## AI Benchmarks & Live Evaluation Infrastructure

Arena Intelligence. (2026, September 2). *Agent Arena Leaderboard: Dynamic ranking of models on how well they orchestrate tools for real-world agentic tasks*. Arena AI. <https://arena.ai/leaderboard/agent>

> **Note**: The Agent Arena leaderboard provides empirical, causal evaluation of frontier models based on over 2.18 million real-world agentic sessions across 58 models. It measures key operational dimensions: net task improvement, confirmed success rate (task outcome explicit confirmation), steerability (landing user pushback/corrections), bash error recovery steps, and tool hallucination rate. Serves as Athena's empirical benchmark and selection matrix for cross-model validation pairings in Protocol 171 (`VER-171-cross-model-validation.md`) and runtime multi-agent ensembling.

LMSYS Org. (2026). *Chatbot Arena LLM Leaderboard*. Large Model Systems Organization. <https://lmarena.ai>

> **Note**: Crowdsourced open evaluation platform evaluating general reasoning, coding, and instruction following via pairwise human preference (Elo rating) across 350+ models. Serves as secondary validation infrastructure for general model capabilities and cost-performance Pareto frontiers.

## How Citations Are Used in This Repository

Inline citations follow APA format: `(Author, Year)`. For example:

- *"The Johari Window divides knowledge into four quadrants"* → (Luft & Ingham, 1955)
- *"Anchoring bias — first number sets the reference point"* → (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
- *"Bounded rationality: execute 'Good Enough' immediately"* → (Simon, 1956)
- *"Graph RAG: from local to global summarization"* → (Edge et al., 2024)
- *"Cross-encoder reranking for retrieval quality"* → (Nogueira & Cho, 2020)
- *"A mathematical theory of communication"* → (Shannon, 1948)
- *"Antifragile systems gain from disorder"* → (Taleb, 2012)

When a concept is referenced frequently across multiple documents, the first instance in each document includes the full inline citation. Subsequent mentions within the same document use the short form.

For AI/ML papers, arXiv links are provided alongside formal publication details where available.
