# Athena Changelog

> **Last Updated**: 22 July 2026

This document provides detailed release notes. For the brief summary, see the README changelog.

> **Note**: Versions v1.0–v1.6 predate the v8.x versioning scheme adopted in January 2026. The version jump reflects a complete architectural rewrite, not skipped releases.

---

## v9.9.5 (22 July 2026)

**Graph-of-Thoughts consolidation & Academic Reference Audit**: Consolidated three overlapping GoT protocols to a single canonical source of truth, and executed an academic citation audit across core system documentation. An earlier "AGoT engine v3.0" framing committed the same day was reverted — Athena's GoT is a reasoning *heuristic*, not a code-level engine (no orchestration loop exists); AGoT (Pandey et al. 2025) is retained as prior-art reference only.

### Key Changes

- **GoT single source of truth (`RSN-505`)**: RSN-505 is now canonical for the GoT method (branch / prune / merge / backtrack). `DEC-137` (decision application, incl. Law #1 ruin-pruning as a scoring criterion) and `PAT-16` (synthetic- vs true-parallel theory) point to it instead of re-defining it. Fixed a stale "/ultrathink auto-activates GoT" claim and malformed frontmatter.
- **Reverted premature AGoT framing**: removed "AGoT engine" claims from `DEC-137`, `ultrathink.md`, `visualize_got.py`, and `bionic-decision-engine`; restored the latter two to their pre-AGoT state.
- **Academic Reference Audit (`docs/REFERENCES.md`)**: Added seminal citations for Besta et al. (ETH Zurich GoT 2024), Pandey et al. (AGoT 2025), and Ole Peters (Ergodicity Economics 2019). Restructured business & strategy literature to cleanly distinguish peer-reviewed academic research from applied industry practice.
- **Documentation Audit & Date Standardization**: Audited all 45+ documentation files across `docs/`, `Athena-Public`, and root, updating all system dates to 22 July 2026.

---

## v9.4.0 (04 March 2026)

**Biological Stack Architecture**: Upgraded routing layer from 3 components to a full biological architecture: 8 Cognitive Systems (Organ System), 15 Cognitive Clusters (Organs), and 5 new protocols (P504-P508).

### Key Changes

- **Cognitive Systems Layer (`P507`)**: Added a macro-routing layer above clusters. 8 systems map to human need archetypes: Survival, Life Decision, Trading, Social, Execution, Growth, Learning, and Maintenance.
- **Intent Classifier (`P508`)**: Replaced flat keyword matching with an 8-question top-down diagnostic tree that routes queries to the correct Cognitive System.
- **`CLUSTER_INDEX.md`**: Updated from 3 starter clusters to the full 15-cluster production map. Linked all clusters to their parent Cognitive Systems.
- **Problem Diagnostics (`P504`)**: New 5-gate problem framing framework to prevent solving the wrong problem.
- **`ensure_env.sh` Fix**: Script now falls back to system Python if no `.venv` is found, reducing onboarding friction for users avoiding virtual environments.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cognitive Systems | 8 |
| Cognitive Clusters | 15 |
| New Protocols | 5 |
| `pyproject.toml` | v9.4.0 |

## v9.3.1 (03 March 2026)

**Cross-Model Audit Fixes**: Resolved 4 missing GitHub releases (v9.2.7–v9.3.0), corrected stale file count claims, relocated Windows compatibility section, synced dates.

### Key Changes

- **File Count Correction** (`README.md`): Updated "370+ Markdown" → "350+" (actual: 354) and "230+ Python scripts" → "600+" (actual: 651). Counts drifted after v9.2.9 dead-skill pruning.
- **Windows Section Relocation** (`README.md`): Moved dangling `## Windows Compatibility` from below the footer into a collapsible `<details>` block under Quickstart.
- **GitHub Release Sync**: Created v9.3.1 release covering v9.2.7–v9.3.0 changelog summaries.
- **Date Sync**: Updated README and CHANGELOG dates to 03 March 2026.

---

## v9.3.0 (02 March 2026)

**Onboarding Friction Audit**: Restructured dependencies, added virtual environment instructions, and fixed 6 onboarding blockers for new users.

### Key Changes

- **Dependency Restructuring** (`pyproject.toml`): Moved `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, `flashrank`, `dspy-ai`, `anthropic`, `supabase`, `google-generativeai` from core dependencies to optional groups (`[search]`, `[cloud]`, `[full]`). Default `pip install -e .` now completes in ~30s without downloading 2GB of PyTorch.
- **Virtual Environment Instructions** (`README.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `FAQ.md`): Added explicit `python3 -m venv .venv` step to Quickstart. Prevents PEP 668 `externally-managed-environment` errors on macOS Homebrew and Ubuntu 23.04+.
- **Two-Tier Install Path** (`README.md`): Lightweight install (default) vs `pip install -e ".[full]"` (vector search + reranking).
- **PEP 668 Troubleshooting** (`FAQ.md`): New troubleshooting entry for the most common install blocker.
- **Stale Path Fix** (`examples/workflows/start.md`): Replaced hardcoded `file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/...` absolute paths with relative paths.
- **URL Fix** (`init.py`): Fixed `[AUTHOR]87` placeholder in init output URL.
- **`requirements-lite.txt`** (NEW): Minimal dependency file for users who want the core framework without ML deps.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Core install deps | 5 (was 11) ✅ |
| Install time (default) | ~30s (was 5-10 min) ✅ |
| PEP 668 addressed | 3 docs ✅ |
| Stale paths fixed | 3 ✅ |

---

## v9.2.9 (02 March 2026)

**Ultrathink v4.1 HITL Bypass + Micro-Pruning**: Added Human-in-the-Loop manual execution path to `/ultrathink`, pruned 10% dead skills for 100% cognitive cluster coverage, and fixed all broken references.

### Key Changes

- **Ultrathink v4.1**: Added Option B (HITL Manual Sandbox) — users can execute the 4 parallel reasoning tracks directly in the Gemini UI at zero API cost, then paste outputs back.
- **Micro-Pruning**: Removed `ui-ux-pro-max/` workflow (skill deleted from private repo). Fixed broken `file://` path in `refactor-code.md`.
- **`generate_skill_index.py`**: Removed dead `sickn33_collection` vendor block (referencing deleted submodule).
- **Cognitive Cluster Coverage**: Updated from 19/21 (90%) to 19/19 (100%) — all orphan skills eliminated.
- **Orchestrator v4.1**: Top-level imports, modern type hints (`dict`/`list`/`tuple`), rate-limit retry with 30s backoff, async deadlock fix.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Broken references fixed | 4 ✅ |
| Security scans passed | 3/3 ✅ |
| Cluster coverage | 100% ✅ |
| Lines removed (net) | -4,192 ✅ |

---

## v9.2.8 (27 February 2026)

**Skill Template Expansion**: Added 5 starter skill templates across 4 categories for new Antigravity users. Skills are copy-paste ready — `cp -r examples/skills/<skill> .agent/skills/`.

### New Skills

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/skills/coding/spec-driven-dev/` | Build a design spec before writing code |
| `examples/skills/research/deep-research-loop/` | Structured multi-source research workflow |
| `examples/skills/quality/red-team-review/` | Adversarial QA review for any artifact |
| `examples/skills/decision/mcda-solver/` | Multi-criteria decision matrix calculator |
| `examples/skills/workflow/context-compactor/` | Compress context to stay within token limits |

### Other Changes

- **`examples/skills/README.md`**: Rewritten with full directory tree, AG Quick Start instructions, and skill creation guide.

---

## v9.2.7 (26 February 2026)

**Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock + Tier 0 Context Summaries**: Engineered the min-latency × max-effectiveness optimization. The Triple-Lock is no longer a flat tax on every query — it's now risk-proportional with three tiers. Boot sequence gains zero-cost context pre-computation.

### Key Changes

- **Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock** (`governance.py`): Added `RiskLevel` enum (SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA). SNIPER queries (Λ < 10) bypass mandatory search — direct answer. STANDARD/ULTRA enforce full Triple-Lock. Default is STANDARD (robustness bias: `cost(false_negative) >> cost(false_positive)`). Risk level auto-resets after each verification.
- **Tier 0 Context Summaries** (`context_summaries.py`, NEW): Pre-computes 500-char compressed summaries of all 6 Memory Bank files at boot. Uses hash-based delta detection — only regenerates when source changes. Cached to `.agent/state/context_cache/`. Zero API cost.
- **Boot Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`): Context summary generation integrated as parallel worker #7 in the ThreadPoolExecutor. Zero sequential boot latency added.
- **REFERENCES.md**: Added 3 new academic citations (Shannon, Satisficing, Antifragility).
- **README**: Updated tech stack routing description to "Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock".

### Design Principles (Three Laws)

1. **Measure latency over the full cycle, not per-response.** Rework is the real latency tax.
2. **Phase-separate classification from execution.** Fast routing, robust processing. Never blend.
3. **When the classifier is uncertain, always round toward robustness.** The cost asymmetry makes this the only rational default.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Governance SNIPER bypass | Verified ✅ |
| SNIPER auto-reset to STANDARD | Verified ✅ |
| STANDARD/ULTRA enforcement | Verified ✅ |
| Context summaries (6/6 files) | Pre-computed ✅ |
| Cache retrieval | Functional ✅ |
| All new code | Lint-clean ✅ |

## v9.2.5 (24 February 2026)

**Life Integration Protocol Stack + Formal Proof Standard**: Extended the reasoning pipeline from domain-specific rigor to domain-general life integration. New protocols for cross-domain constraint propagation, personalized learning, and emotional auditing.

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 381 (Formal Proof Standard)**: New — 6 rules for mathematical proofs and mechanism design (Derive Never Assert, Steelman Alternatives, Numerical Examples, Scope Boundaries, Adversarial Robustness, Dynamic Extensions).
- **Protocol 382 (Cross-Domain Constraint Propagation)**: New — prevents domain-siloed advice by auto-surfacing time/energy/money conflicts across life domains.
- **Protocol 383 (Personalized Learning Acquisition)**: New — 90-day outcome mapping, spaced repetition scaffolding, plateau detection.
- **Protocol 000 Extended (8-Step Audit Loop)**: Added Step 0.3 (Emotional Audit), Step 0.5 (Assumption Register), Step 1.5 (Stakeholder Map), Step 3.7 (Sensitivity Sweep), and "Depth over Checkbox" quality rule.
- **Core Identity §0.4 Expanded**: Added Post-Generation Self-Audit (9-item checklist, Λ > 60) and Life-Domain Protocol Trigger Map (10 autonomic triggers).
- **`/review` Workflow**: New weekly integration review — cross-domain health check, constraint conflict detection, decision triage.

### Verification

> **Note on Protocol Count**: The drop from 285 (v1.2.8) to 150+ reflects a \"Great Purge\" audit that removed redundant, experimental, and superseded protocols. The count now reflects only **production-grade, actively-maintained** protocols.

---

## v8.1-Performance (30 January 2026)

**Semantic Cache & Latency Optimization**: Implemented true semantic caching for intelligent query reuse.

### Key Changes

- **Semantic Caching**: Upgraded `QueryCache` to store query embeddings and perform cosine similarity matching (threshold 0.90). Similar queries now return cached results instantly.
- **Search Latency**: Reduced from 30s+ to <5s (exact match) and ~0s (semantic match).
- **Pre-Warming**: Boot sequence now pre-caches 3 "hot" queries (`protocol`, `session`, `user profile`) for instant first-search response.
- **GraphRAG Optimization**: Added `--global-only` flag to skip redundant local model loading.

### Verification

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| First Search | 30s+ (hanging) | **4.71s** |
| Exact Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |

  - Creates `session_logs/` directory structure
  - Generates timestamped session log files
  - Verifies Core_Identity.md integrity (SHA-256)
  - Primes semantic memory (if Supabase configured)
- **`examples/framework/Core_Identity.md`** (NEW): Sanitized Laws #0-6, Committee of Seats, Λ scoring
- **MANIFESTO.md**: Added "Bionic Unit" and "Law #6: Triple-Lock" sections
- **RISK_PLAYBOOKS.md**: Added Tier Classification legend (Tier 1/2/3 with icons)
- **Metrics**: Sessions 810, Protocols 285

### Philosophy

*From*: "Here is the author's Brain."
*To*: "Here is the Framework to Build Your Own Brain."

The public repo now provides the *engine*, not just the *manual*.

---

## v1.2.9 (09 January 2026)

**Docs & Insights Update**: README enhanced with new positioning insights.

### Key Changes

- **Sessions**: 805 (synced from workspace)
- **Featured Badge**: Added r/GeminiAI #2 Daily badge
- **"Why This Matters" Section**:
  - Added "Zero operational burden" insight — single-user local tool = real complexity, zero ops chaos
  - Added "Bilateral growth" insight — system evolves alongside user

**Rationale**: Captured positioning insights from session discussions for recruiter clarity.

---

## v1.2.8 (06 January 2026)

**Grand Alignment Refactor**: Supabase schema hardened (11 tables + RLS), Memory Insurance layer stabilized.

### Key Changes

- **Metrics Corrected**: Protocols audited to 285, sessions at 768, scripts at 122
- **Memory Insurance**: Formalized the concept of Supabase as disaster recovery layer, not just search
- **Schema Hardening**: All 11 Supabase tables now have RLS enabled and hardened search paths

**Rationale**: The previous protocol count (332) included archived items. This release establishes accurate canonical metrics.

---

## v1.2.6 (05 January 2026)

**Stats Sync**: 605 sessions, 277 protocols, 119 scripts

### Backend Refactor: `athena.memory.sync`

Major architectural cleanup of the Supabase sync pipeline:

- **`supabase_sync.py`**: Refactored to use the `athena` SDK pattern. Cleaner separation between embedding generation and database operations.
- **`public_sync.py`**: New tool for sanitized sync to `Athena-Public`. Ensures private memories never leak to the public repository.
- **`athena.tools.macro_graph`**: Added macro-level knowledge graph tooling for visualizing cross-file relationships.

**Rationale**: The previous sync scripts were monolithic and tightly coupled. This refactor enables:

- Independent testing of embedding vs. storage logic
- Safer public sync with explicit sanitization
- Foundation for future multi-tenant support

### Governance: Cognitive Profile Refinements

Integrated red-team feedback into Athena's cognitive profile:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bionic vs Proxy Mode** | Ambiguous distinction | Explicit: Bionic = independent thinking, Proxy = drafting voice |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Informal | Percentages require empirical data + falsification checks |
| **Dehumanizing Language** | Hard invariant | Relaxed for biological/predatory frames when contextually appropriate |

**Source**: External red-team audit (Session 560-571)
